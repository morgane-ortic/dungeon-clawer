# DUNGEON CLAWER

## Python text based Role-Playing Game

Dungeon clawer is based on the d20 system, notably used by Dungeons & Dragons.

It enables you to play as an adventurer in a multiple-choice fantasy adventure, including epic combats and skill-based situation resolution.

The game is currently at a very basic development level. My plan is to progressively add features and story chapters and see how far it goes.

Currently implemented features include:

* A stats system for both the player character and NPCs (meaning all important characters have their own character sheet, very much like in a table-top or video game RPG)
    â†’ NPCs can be added to the game manually to 'npcs.json' with any text editor/IDE
* A basic combat system using dices and bonuses from the characters' stats
* A basic story system
