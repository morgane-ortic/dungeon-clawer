            "wake_up_20": "Thanks to your night vision, you can see that everything seems in order in the small inn room.\nBy your side, the cutie you're spending your night with is still sleeping peacefully.\nIn the other beds, the other travellers seem to be enjoying their rest too. Everything looks calm.",

            "wake_up_30": "Yet you still feel the stress. The images come back to you:\nThe demon wars, the Absolut, fighting, death... your heart burning and almost consuming you whole...\nAnd what has been perhaps bothering you the most lately.",

            "wake_up_40": "It was a clean breakup somehow, the cleanest you have ever had.\n Not that you have a lot of experience in the matter... but anyway, it still hurts as fuck.\n You look at the babe sleeping by your side.\nThe evening was great, but now that the hotness and the adrenaline have faded you feel your broken heart aching again."
